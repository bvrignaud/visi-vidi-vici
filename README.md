**Welcome to Visi-vidi-vici!**
Visi-vidi-vici is a marine weather forecasting application for determining water clarity for all divers.

## Installation

Visi-vidi-vici is a regular Laravel application; it's build on top of Laravel 11 and uses Inertia / Vue / Tailwind CSS
for the frontend.

In terms of local development, you can use the following requirements:

- PHP 8.4 - with SQLite, and other common extensions.
- Node.js 22 or more recent.

If you have these requirements, you can start by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bvrignaud/visi-vidi-vici.git

cd visi-vidi-vici
```

Next, install the dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
composer install

pnpm install
```

After that, set up your `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env

php artisan key:generate
```

Prepare your database and run the migrations:

```bash
touch database/database.sqlite

php artisan migrate --seed
```

Link the storage to the public folder:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

In a **separate terminal**, build the assets in watch mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Also in a **separate terminal**, run the queue worker:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

Finally, start the development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Once you are done with the code changes, be sure to run the test suite to ensure everything is still working:

```bash
php artisan test
```
